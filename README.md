# MediocreFPSGodotSamples
 Title says it all

This is a repo of small FPS projects I've worked on, the folder titles are a bit werid so let me explain them.

I will have a video on my Youtube channel showing a demo but this reddit post in the meantime does justice to what you could expect from the entire repo

## WARNING 
The code in this project is not clean but it works, I just hope I can show people different methods of doing the exact same thing also this is me trying to fill in the 3d resources I wish I had when I started. My discord is `NAD LABS#6937` if you need to ask me anything about any of the code. If a lot of people ask me questions about this I might make a discord server idk abt that. 

### Try your best to learn from this or just take the entire project and run with it, idc
